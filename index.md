## Daily Activities
**_1/18/19_**
- Met with Ryan
- Went into specifics about the Blog Bot
- We agreed that the recommended amount of words is 500-1000 words

**_1/24/19_**
- Creating the Web Crawler
- Research about developing the Web Crawler


**_1/29/19_**
- Created an offline Wordpress plugin
- Research important keywords and phrases for the Blog Bot

**_2/1/19_**<p>
Met with Ryan and Lonnie via Google Hangouts and discussed:<p>
- Page Optimzer Pro, an application that will help us tremendously
- How to get high on Google Rankings
- Potential faults with the Blog Bot, regarding potential issues that could hurt the Google ranking of a website

**_2/6/19_**
- Talked about creating the team website
- Updating the Web Crawler application

**_2/12/19_**
Today we created a website that will provide the details of all our team meetings, hold each team member's developer notes, and discusses the progress we have made with our project throughout the semester. We tested the Web Crawler and it was able to find articles relating to our keywords. Lastly, we tried out Page Optimizer Pro for the first time. Lonnie recommended that we take a look at Page Optimizer Pro because he believed it would help us understand how to improve the Google rankings of the Wordpress articles. 

**_3/1/19_**
Early this morning, we met with Ryan to talk about Page Optimizer Pro. This was the tool that Lonnie said would help us get a start on our plugin. In addition, we gave him an update on our project. Currently, our prototype consists of the Web Crawler and an offline Wordpress plugin. Our Wordpress plugin can find articles relevant to the keyword provided, copy the article and publish a copy of the article to the offline Wordpress site.

**_3/4/19_**
- Met at Presentation U to review presentation that will be presented on Wednesday March 6
- Presentation was critiqued by Presentation U tutor
- Listened to suggestions made by Presentation U tutor
- Practiced Architecture Design Presentation

**_3/5/19_**
Today we had a meeting to practice presenting our Architecture Design Presentation. 

- Meeting to practive Architecture Design Presentation
- Met with Ryan to show prototype of project

**_3/6/19_**
Today, we presented our Architecture Design. In it describes the functions of the Web Crawler, Scraper, Plugin and Database. We provided a timeline that projects each step that it takes to create the Blog Bot. In addition, we added some strech goals that we would like to accomplish if the time permits. 

**_3/19/19_**
- Met with Ryan
- Presented prototype

**_4/3/19_**
We met today and talked about what each person will be working on moving forward. Grace will be working on the database. She will use a Lamp server which should be compatible with our Web Scraper. In our database, we will save the articles that were used to generate the article so that when the web crawler is looking for articles, it will avoid articles that we have already discovered. Grace mentioned that she was having difficulty logging into her Mutilab account. However, she mentioned that she will find a way to get access to her account and start the process of creating a LAMP server. The LAMP server will hold the list of pages that we need to fetch and the list of pages that we have already fetched. That way, we avoid looking for content that we have already discovered. If we still have time, we would like to add the date that the article was fetched to the database. Jacob mentioned that we need an adjacency list, where each URL followed by the thing that the URL points to on its page. Dean stated that he will work on getting the Wordpress plugin to call the Script. Then, we talked more about the database. We mentioned that the database will save the URL of the webpage of the fetched articles so that we not only know have a record of discovered article, but we can retract back to the webpage if needed be. We all agreed that the difficult task is figuring out how to store Python dictionaries into a SQL database. Dean mentioned that he was made LAMP servers in the past and that we could probably use a LAMP server for our project. Grace plans to work on creating the LAMP server once she figures out what is going on with her Multilab account. Dean suggested that Grace work on the LAMP Server on his desktop and Grace agreed that would be a good solution if she is not able to get her account working. Someone brought that they would like to have a sample of the database ready before we visit Ryan. As of now, we are still figuring out a time that we all can meet. Jacob created a list that describes all of the things we need to do as of now. Jacob also went more into detail about the adjacency list, entailing what the adjacency list will do as well as why it is needed. Dean made up a list of things that he plans to do within the next few days. He mentioned that he plans to create a plugin settings menu that calls Jacob's script and then saves to draft. Once again, we brought up the database. We wanted to figure out if it is possible to store a Python list or dictionary in a database. Shortly after, we concluded the meeting.

**_4/7/19_**
On Sunday, Grace went to Dean's house to create a LAMP server on Dean's virtual machine. They had some issues with permissions but were able to work around that. Finally, they were able to install mySQL and eventually, the LAMP Server was created. Grace will be working on the database. Grace will start off by creating a database with sample entries for the meantime. 

**_4/8/19_**
Today, we created a settings page that calls the Script in order to create a new article and saves the article as a draft. 


Thursday 


**_4/15/19_**
Today, we met and discussed what other parts of the project need to be worked on. For the Coding Assigment Presentation, we would like to use Ryan's FTP permissions to install the plugin and the Python script. We logged into Ryan's FTP and discvovered that it did not work. For the presentation, we will provide screenshoos of the local Wordpress plugin. Grace mentioned that she would like to get the Scraper and Database integrated.
